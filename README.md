**Potato Disease Prediction** <br>
This project is a **Potato Disease Prediction System** using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and classifies potato leaf images into three categories:

* **Potato Early Blight**
* **Potato Late Blight**
* **Healthy Leaf**

The trained model is deployed in a **Flask web application** where users can upload a potato leaf image. The system predicts the disease with a confidence score. This project aims to support farmers in **early disease detection** and improve crop yield through AI-based solutions.
